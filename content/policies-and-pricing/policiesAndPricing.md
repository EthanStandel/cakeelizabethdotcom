## CAKE PRICING

Whether you are searching for the impossibly smooth look of fondant or a more whimsical creation, our wedding cakes are made to impress. Our wedding clients often rave about our signature Golden Champagne Cake with fruit filling. You can be certain your cake will be baked fresh for your big day.

The best cakes are created with the help of our clients. We ask that you order your cake at least 6 weeks ahead of time. Schedule your tasting as soon as possible.

We encourage you to bring your ideas! The more you can show us, the easier it will be for us to match your style. We encourage you to bring pictures or clippings of ideas you would like to explore. Bring us a picture of your dress, the bridesmaidsâ€™ dresses and invitations. All these clues help guide the creative process and make for picture-perfect cakes that capture the mood and style of your dream day.

## Returns

We take the utmost precautions in building and storing your cake before pick up and will give you detailed instructions on handling and storing it. Once the cake leaves our premises our responsibility ends. If you are not satisfied with your product, you must return it to us so we can verify your claim, and issue a refund. It is important we can physically examine and taste the cake before issuing a refund.
