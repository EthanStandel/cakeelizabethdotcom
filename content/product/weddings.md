Whether you are searching for the impossibly smooth look of fondant or a more whimsical creation, our wedding cakes are made to impress. Our wedding clients often rave about our signature Golden Champagne Cake with fruit filling. You can be certain your cake will be baked fresh for your big day.

The best cakes are created with the help of our clients. We ask that you order your cake at least 6 weeks ahead of time. Schedule your tasting as soon as possible.

We encourage you to bring your ideas! The more you can show us, the easier it will be for us to match your style. We encourage you to bring pictures or clippings of ideas you would like to explore. Bring us a picture of your dress, the bridesmaids’ dresses and invitations. All these clues help guide the creative process and make for picture-perfect cakes that capture the mood and style of your dream day.

### Our Process

#### Here’s how to order a wedding cake:

First you must schedule a tasting to help select your perfect cake. This tasting includes 3 flavors of each: cake, filling and frosting of your choice. We will have those combinations here for you both to taste and a glass of chilled white wine to cleanse your palate. The $45 dollar charge for the tasting will be applied towards your total balance when your cake is booked with us, provided the total amount of the order is above $200. Plan to spend at least an hour but possibly more, so we can calmly discuss your ideas and come up with the perfect cake for your event! So, browse our Flavors page, click on the Schedule Your Tasting tab, fill out the form, press submit, and we will contact you ASAP! Please note that tastings must be prepaid, so send us a check or call us with your credit card information.
