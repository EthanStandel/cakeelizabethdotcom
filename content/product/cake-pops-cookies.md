#### Cookies

We make delicious, iced, sugar cookies that we can match to your party, theme, or color. They can also be customized to be your wedding favors with a thank you, a monogram, a wedding cake, or even a bridal gown and tuxedo! We have a large collection of Maine cutters like sailboats, lighthouses, lobsters, assorted seashells, loons, acorns, redbirds and moose to choose from as well.

One dozen minimum order.
Call for pricing.

#### Cake-pops

Cake-pops are a truffle on a stick, covered in dark or white chocolate. They make great small bites for children’s birthday parties, figure conscious gals, or when you just want a little sweet, they make a great addition to a cake as well when you are having both adults and children at a gathering. At Cake Elizabeth, we can make them in different shapes and many flavors to suit your needs!
