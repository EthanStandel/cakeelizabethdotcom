## Cake Pops & Cookies

#### Cookies
We make delicious, iced, sugar cookies that we can match to your party, theme, or color. They can also be
customized to be your wedding favors with a thank you, a monogram, a wedding cake, or even a bridal gown
and tuxedo! We have a large collection of Maine cutters like sailboats, lighthouses, lobsters, assorted
seashells, loons, acorns, redbirds and moose to choose from as well.

One dozen minimum order.\
Call for pricing.

#### Cake-pops
Cake-pops are a truffle on a stick, covered in dark or white chocolate. They make great small bites for
childrenâ€™s birthday parties, figure conscious gals, or when you just want a little sweet, they make a great
addition to a cake as well when you are having both adults and children at a gathering. At Cake Elizabeth, we
can make them in different shapes and many flavors to suit your needs!

Flavors:\
Chocolate, Vanilla, Strawberry, Red Velvet, Lemon.\
One doz. minimum order. 6 minimum per flavor.\
