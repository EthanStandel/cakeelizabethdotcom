### Pricing

We use pricing by the individual serving or slice to price our cakes. We take into account the number of servings, the complexity of the design, and the materials and techniques involved in coming up with a price for your cake. Some smaller cakes might take longer to create than larger ones and therefore will be a higher price by the slice.

Our minimum order for Mini Cupcakes and Regular Cupcakes is $36.00 and for cakes $50.00.

### Delivery
We can deliver to most of Maine and New Hampshire . Delivery within Cape Elizabeth is free of charge. We charge a flat fee of $35.00 within the South Portland and Portland Area and a $55.00 flat fee in the 50 mile radius. If outside of the 50 mile radius, we charge an additional 75c per mile.

Wedding cakes will have a different delivery charge depending on location and delivery price will be included in the quote.

### Returns
We take the utmost precautions in building and storing your cake before pick up and will give you detailed instructions on handling and storing it. Once the cake leaves our premises our responsibility ends. If you are not satisfied with your product, you must return it to us so we can verify your claim, and issue a refund. It is important we can physically examine and taste the cake before issuing a refund.
