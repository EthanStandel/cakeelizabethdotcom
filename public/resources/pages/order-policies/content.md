### Returns
We take the utmost precautions in building and storing your cake before pick up and will give you detailed instructions on handling and storing it. Once the cake leaves our premises our responsibility ends. If you are not satisfied with your product, you must return it to us so we can verify your claim, and issue a refund. It is important we can physically examine and taste the cake before issuing a refund.
