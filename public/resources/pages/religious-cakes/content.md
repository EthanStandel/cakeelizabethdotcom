## Religious Cakes

Let blessed events shine in the memories of your guests with a cake that marks this momentous day.
We make heavenly cakes for Christenings, Confirmations, First Communions, Passover, Bar, and Bat Mitzvahs!

Try our traditional tiered cakes that are lovingly hand-decorated. Or you may want to order a sheet
cake with your choice of special words for this wondrous occasion that will be forever remembered.
