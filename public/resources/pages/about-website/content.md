## Thanks for visiting the new Cake Elizabeth Website!

Hi, my name's Ethan!

I'm the husband of Kristina, the owner. I'm an avid technology enthusiast as well as a software engineer. It's always 
been Kristina's dream to be able to own and run her own bakery and I always promised her that I would own the website
and technical assets and so here we are! Before this version was built, the site was lovingly maintained by 
[Mainely SEO](https://www.mainelyseo.com/) who did a fantastic job! However, it was always my intention that I would 
be writing the site for Kristina's business. So we've been carefully transferring the mantle from their care.

I've been trying to develop the website to keep the core well-used functionalities in-tact while trying to cut out
the features that Patty, the previous owner, didn't end up using, and Kristina does not intend to use. If you have a problem
with the website or find that a feature you've used in the past is missing, please either 
[file an issue on Github](https://github.com/EthanStandel/cakeelizabethdotcom/issues) or just shoot me an email personally at 
[ethan@standel.io](mailto:ethan@standel.io)!

If you're interested in how the website was built, feel free to [check it out Github](https://github.com/EthanStandel/cakeelizabethdotcom)
as I've open-sourced the code. Otherwise, thanks for visiting the site, and a huge thanks to the tools and platforms that make
this kind of fast-paced development possible. Below is the full list of software utilized and their associated licenses.
