## Dessert Bars

The trend today in many celebrations is to have something for everyone. With today’s
dietary restrictions it is hard to please and accommodate everyone at a large gathering.
Here at Cake Elizabeth, we can accommodate mostly everyone by putting together an assortment
of small desserts that will be all-inclusive. Whether you are a cookie lover, donut freak,
cheesecake fan or healthy eater, we have something for you. Can’t decide on just one flavor
of cake? Let’s do two, or three or four! Call us for a list of goodies and pricing. We can take
care of the whole thing, from platters, to napkins and plates , or we work with your planner on
her vision for the display. Variety is the name of the game!
